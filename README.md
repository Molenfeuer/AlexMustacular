# Alex Mus-tacular
Alex is by far the fittest person in Stardew Valley, but his body doesn't look like that. To make his appearance match his workout (when he's on ""some""" steroids) I developed this mod. Besides, this mod exists to annoy a friend ;)

## Credits

- First of all thanks to [ConcernedApe](https://twitter.com/concernedape) for developing Stardew Valley and the Sprites my own Textures based on!
- A big thanks to [CommanderWaddles](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/64707721) for publishing the modification (NSFW) [... Alex Muscular Sprite](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3388). I use his idea and sprites as base for my modification. The main difference between our mods (and the reason for me to develop this piece of code) is that my version is mostly SFW and compatible with the latest StardewValley Version. I give Alex a shirt and pants, add missing poses and improve his muscularity
- Thanks to [AkiraWilliams / ikeychain](https://next.nexusmods.com/users/2920800) for the hair sprite which Ã®s used by  ... Alex Muscular Sprite!
- Furthermore, a huuuuge thanks for [Pathoschild](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/1552317) to develop [SMAPI](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400) and [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915). This modification uses both of these technologies to run!
- Also, huge thanks to [Poltergeist](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/2679113) for the mod [Seasonal Outfits](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5450). I was strongly influenced by their outfits and adopted the rough style for my outfits. A direct copy was not possible due to a certain NPC, who found Gusâ€™s protein powder stash
- I am delighted that some people helped me with the translation to make the mod understandable for everyone. I would like to thank [ConfusedWolf](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/15421504) (English), [zenychan](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/108249578) (Turkish, before version 5.0.0), A. B.
